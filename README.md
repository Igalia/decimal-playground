# Decimal Playground

> ðŸš§ Under Construction ðŸš§

A playground for investigating design directions for the [Ecma TC39 JavaScript Decimal proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal).  
When it exists, it will be at: https://sarahghp.github.io/decimal-playground/.

Based heavily on the [Records & Tuples Playground](https://rickbutton.github.io/record-tuple-playground/) from [Rick Button at Bloomberg](https://github.com/bloomberg/record-tuple-polyfill/tree/master/packages/record-tuple-playground)
